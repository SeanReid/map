A Ruby on Rails web app using Leaflet.js to display a custom Mapbox map. There are plotted locations with popups
and polygons outlining locations. The assignment was a one day homework assignment at The Iron Yard. I combined 
social login, which was learned later in the week. I also outlined a few areas on the map along with popups on 
click. There is also a random video background it wasn't part of the assignment just something I wanted to try 
and figure out.
